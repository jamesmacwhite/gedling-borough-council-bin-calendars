<p>Gedling Borough Council provides 20 different refuse/waste collections and 10 garden waste collections. Depending on the area within the Gedling district, a specific weekday and schedule name is assigned. Using this search tool, you can find the specific collection information for bin collections.</p>

<p class="fw-bold text-danger">You must enter a street name that is within the Gedling local authority. No additional informaiton such as property numbers or postcode should be entered.</p>

{% include find-collection-schedule.html %}

<p>Some street name queries will return multiple collections, due to being on an area boundary. When multiple results are returned, the area and in some cases property numbers are shown to help identify the correct collection. This additional data is provided by Gedling Borough Council.</p>

<h2 class="h3">About the search data</h2>

<p>This search tool uses data from the <a href="{{ site.gedlingRefuseSearchUrl }}">Gedling Borough Council refuse collection days search</a>. The search result format provided by apps.gedling.gov.uk does not directly provide the collection weekday or schedule name but this search tool scrapes the data and formats the information in a more readable format.</p>
